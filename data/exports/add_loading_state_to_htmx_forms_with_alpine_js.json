{"title":"Add Loading State to HTMX Forms with Alpine.js","content":"Context\nI have a FastAPI + HTMX + Alpine.js web application. I want to add loading states to forms that submit via HTMX so users see visual feedback (button text changes, button gets disabled) while the request is processing.\n\nRequirements\n\nAdd loading states to the following forms:\n\n1. Create form in templates/index.html\n2. Edit form in templates/components/prompt_card.html\n\nImplementation Steps\n\nFor each form, make these changes:\n\n1. Add Alpine.js loading state to the <form> tag:\nhtml\nNote: If the form already has @htmx:after-request with other code, append loading = false; to the beginning of that code.\n\n2. Update the submit button:\nhtml\n3. Optionally disable the cancel button during loading:\nhtml\nAlpine.js Directives Used\n\n•  x-data=\"{ loading: false }\" - Creates a reactive loading state\n•  @htmx:before-request - HTMX event that fires before sending request\n•  @htmx:after-request - HTMX event that fires after request completes\n•  :disabled=\"loading\" - Binds the disabled attribute to loading state\n•  :class - Dynamically adds CSS classes based on state\n•  x-show - Shows/hides elements based on condition\n\nExpected Behavior\n\n•  When user clicks submit, button text changes from \"Save\" to \"Saving...\"\n•  Button becomes disabled and visually grayed out (opacity-50)\n•  Cancel button also becomes disabled to prevent conflicts\n•  After server responds, button returns to normal state\n•  Works for both successful and failed requests\n\nFiles to Modify\n\n1. templates/index.html - The create form (around line 25-70)\n2. templates/components/prompt_card.html - The edit form (around line 32-73)","created_at":"2025-11-14T08:33:56.296637","updated_at":"2025-11-14T08:33:56.296641","notes":[{"content":"This prompt was generated after the feature development and contains implementation specifics.","created_at":"2025-11-14T09:36:22.406707","updated_at":"2025-11-17T12:47:39.095383"}]}
